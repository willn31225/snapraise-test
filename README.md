## Reverse Polish Notation Calculator

This is an implementation of an RPN Calculator using TDD and written in PHP 7.4 from scratch. The following packages were used during development:

To speed up development Symfony/Console was used to facilitate the cli for the app.
PHPUnit was used for writing unit tests.

The code is broken up into the following class groups:

- Calculator
- IO
- Parser
- Validator
